# EI_Assignment Repository

This repository contains my solutions for the placement assignment.  
It includes two major exercises: **Exercise1 (Design Patterns)** and **Exercise2 (SmartOffice System)**.  
All code is well-organized, modular, and follows global coding best practices.

## Exercise1 - Design Patterns

### Problem Statement
Come up creatively with six different use cases to demonstrate understanding of software design patterns.  
- 2 use cases of Behavioral Design Patterns  
- 2 use cases of Creational Design Patterns  
- 2 use cases of Structural Design Patterns  

### Implemented Patterns
#### Behavioral
1. Observer Pattern: NewsAgency notifies subscribers (Email, SMS).  
2. Strategy Pattern: Payment system with multiple strategies (Card, UPI, Wallet).  

#### Creational
3. Factory Method Pattern: VehicleFactory creates Car or Bike dynamically.  
4. Builder Pattern: StudentProfile built step-by-step with optional fields.  

#### Structural
5. Adapter Pattern: Square adapted to behave like a Rectangle.  
6. Decorator Pattern: Dynamic enhancements to messages (Encryption, Timestamp).

## Exercise2 - SmartOffice System

### Problem Statement
Design and implement a SmartOffice Management System that simulates core operations in an office.  
The system demonstrates Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) principles with well-structured Java classes.

### Features Implemented
- Employee Management: Add, remove, and view employees.  
- Meeting Room Booking: Employees can reserve office meeting rooms.  
- Access Control: Role-based access (Manager, Staff).  
- Notifications: Simple notification mechanism to employees.  
- Bill and Expense Tracking: Track office expenses such as electricity and internet.  

### Technologies Used
- Java (Core OOP principles: Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism).  
- Exception Handling and Validations at all levels.  
- Logging and Defensive Programming to ensure reliability.
